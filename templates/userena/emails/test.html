Congrats on joining Inta, a new but promising way to surf the crowd rather than the web, consuming by topic rather than source.

•	First come and join topics you are interested in.  If you want more, simply tell us.  
•	Then get familiar with the basics of how we sort the lists.  Everything, from gathering content to ranking it, is fueled by our users.  Individually, we ask for little, but in the aggregate this results in our time saving and experience heightening lists!
•	While you will now be ready to enjoy, remember, if you are generous to them, the lists will be far more generous in return.  Hit post or double post if you find an article good or great, and when you find something away from the site, take a second to add it to the list. 

Here’s your verification link, go get started!

Enjoy, 
The Inta Team.
