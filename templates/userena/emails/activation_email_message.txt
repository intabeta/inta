Congrats on joining Inta, a new but promising way to surf the crowd
rather than the web, consuming by topic rather than source.

First come and join topics you are interested in. If you want more,
simply tell us.

Then get familiar with the basics of how we sort the lists.
Everything, from gathering content to ranking it, is fueled by our
users. Individually, we ask for little, but in the aggregate this results in our time saving, see everything at a glance lists!

While you will now be ready to enjoy, remember, if you are generous to
them, the lists will be far more generous in return. Hit post or
double post if you find an article good or great, and when you find
something away from the site, take a second to add it to the list.  To vote via post hit the black expand button alongside an article
title, and to submit the plugin is extremely easy.

Here's your verification link, go get started!

Enjoy,

The Inta Team.
