<p>

<p> The idea for this site began because of frustration. Frustration from feeling limited to checking the same few sites multiple times a day, only to have them not update or not go into further detail on topics that really interested me. Frustration knowing how great a blog could be, but not knowing which ones I could trust for which topics. Frustration that most articles I read didn’t provoke a second thought, while I knew I was missing tons that did. Frustration that there are millions of writers contributing to our collective knowledge and empathy, doing their best each day to make the Internet and our world more interesting, yet I was only sampling a small part of it. Frustration there wasn’t anything simple solving these frustrations. </p>


<p> That frustration motivated me to try out a new system, to make tools where everyone could pitch in with a small effort so collectively we could have a huge reward. A place we can check anytime, numerous times, for a worthwhile read. One that lets us dive deeper into the topics we already love, while making connecting with new topics and their passionate communities too easy not to do. A pedestal for the true gems, the content that is worth far more than the time it takes to read or watch, of each topic so we can find them for more than a few days. </p>


<p> So this is the start, our first set of tools, yet the Internet makes even simple tools extremely powerful when in the hands of many. Think of Wikipedia, or Youtube, or watch this video to realize every one of us, at least the Facebook users, Tweeters, or Ticketmaster fans, have taken part in translating two million books each year (<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration.html">ReCaptcha TED talk: 750 Million Helpers and Counting</a>). Hopefully we will each buy into that collective power, reflecting for a second after each thing we read, so at any moment we can find inspiration or a laugh, whether from a blogger, a columnist, or maybe even a dad. </p>


<p> Every link should be rewarding, let’s make it that way. </p>
